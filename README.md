# Stock Market Prediction Project

Stock market price prediction is a crucial area of financial research and data-driven decision-making. This project aims to build a comprehensive predictive model that can analyze historical stock data and forecast future stock prices using various machine learning and deep learning techniques. The dataset used for this study consists of stock price records of the State Bank of India (SBI), spanning multiple years. It includes key financial indicators such as opening price, closing price, highest and lowest prices of the day, adjusted closing price, and trading volume. By leveraging this dataset, the project explores the patterns and relationships between these variables to develop a robust prediction system.
